“The federal government said they would ‘take the time to get it right,’ and took weeks to present a huge, brand-new amendment package that dramatically changes aspects of the bill,” he told the National Post.

“They then limited time to study it and forced MPs into a condensed series of meetings, limiting time for reflection.”

One concern is how the bill expands licence revocation, specifically concerning so-called “red flag” laws, which would allow anyone to file an emergency weapons prohibition order in court against those who may pose a danger to themselves, or potentially provide firearms to somebody already under prohibition. 

Bill C-21 would also allow Canada’s chief firearms officer to summarily revoke firearms licences in cases of domestic violence, criminal harassment or protection orders.
